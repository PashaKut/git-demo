Fool me one time 
Shame on you
Fool me twice 
Can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times
Fuck the peace signs
Load the chopper let it rain on you

Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved

No role models 
And I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searching through my memory
My memory
I couldn't find one

Last night I was getting my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina, but I swear to God
This bitch will make you your girl up and tell her,
